# Huffman Coding Implementation in Python

This Python project provides functionality for Huffman coding, a popular algorithm for lossless data compression. Huffman coding works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, thereby achieving compression.

## Testing

This project includes unit tests written with `unittest` to ensure the correctness of the Huffman coding implementation. These tests cover various scenarios to validate the functionality of the code.

## Usage Example

1. **Installation**: Before running the project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adebay8/coding-challenges.git
   cd huffman-coding
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 ./tests/test.py
```
3. **Navigate to the Root Directory and install dependencies**:
```bash
   cd huffman-coding
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Run the tests**

```bash
   python3 ./tests/test.py
```
