- obtain the frequency table 
- using the frequency table create the priority queue with the key as the frequency
- prioriy queuse need something to compare by
- using the priority queue construct the huffman tree

Huffman tree 
    - node 
        - left, right, frequency
        - the frequency of each node is the sum of its left and right frequency
        - constructor (left, right) 
    - leaf node
        - the actual characters in a huffman tree are only stored in leaf nodes
